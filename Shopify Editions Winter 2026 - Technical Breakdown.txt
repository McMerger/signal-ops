## Overview

Shopify Editions Winter 2026 is a highly technical, art-inspired web experience that pushes the boundaries of WebGL, 3D rendering, and web performance. The project showcases classical paintings brought to life with 3D depth, custom animations, and interactive elements.

---

## ???? WebGL & 3D Rendering

### Core Technology Stack
- **Three.js** and **React Three Fiber (R3F)** as the foundation
- Each painting is a unique WebGL scene rendered as an R3F Portal
- Custom shaders, post-processing effects, and animations for each scene

### 3D Model Creation Methods

#### Method 1: Depth Map Displacement
- Generate a depth map from static paintings
- Use the depth map to displace a densely subdivided plane
- Creates depth while preserving fine details from the original artwork

#### Method 2: AI-Assisted 3D Modeling
- Leverage **@tripoai** to generate base mesh silhouettes
- Paint textures onto meshes using **Substance Painter**
- Custom modifications in **Blender** (rigging, animation)
- Export models as GLTF files

---

## ⚡ Performance Optimizations

### GLTF File Optimization
- Built a **custom Electron app** to:
  - Reduce polygon count
  - Convert textures to GPU-friendly **Basis/ETC1S** format
- Compressed textures use **10-100x less memory**
- Instant uploads prevent decoding lags during scrolling

### Shader Optimizations
- Compute noise textures as **DataTextures** on the first frame
- Add simple animations using cos/sin functions on top
- Optimized "sobel effect" using **fwidth**, saving 3 texture lookups

### Quality Tier System (4 Levels)
1. **High:** Full 3D with post-processing
2. **Medium/Low:** Simplified textures and geometry
3. **Fallback:** Static images replace 3D
4. **WebGL Fallback:** Pure CSS

- Auto-detection based on user's GPU capacity
- Real-time downgrade based on current FPS

---

## ???? Animation & Workflow

### Theatre.js Integration
- **@theatre_js** revolutionized the animation workflow
- Designers get After Effects-like control over the website
- Control absolutely everything without code changes
- Animation iteration time: **hours → minutes**

### Rive Optimizations
- **@rive_app** optimization critical due to 20+ animations on top of WebGL
- **Hover animations:** Use first frame as poster, play Rive on hover
- **Linear animations:** Custom Rive-to-video exporter runs them off main thread

---

## ???? Easter Egg: WebRTC Window Streaming

### Technical Implementation
- Stream main Three.js canvas to popup via **WebRTC at 60fps**
- No duplicate scene rendering needed
- **BroadcastChannel** syncs position/size/scroll between windows
- Creates transparent window effect with real-time event messaging

### Popup Rendering
- Lightweight Three.js scene in popup
- Video feed textured onto cube matching main window dimensions
- Composited with custom shaders
- Enables graffiti black-light effect

---

## ???? Front-End Optimizations

### React Performance
- Optimized every React render loop
- Used **Zustand** for state management when needed

### Skills Cloud Component
- Gets live **Sidekick usage** data
- Sent via **Server-Sent Events (SSE)**

### Intro Sequence
- Fast loading with **CSS + SVG** transitions/animations
- Uses `pathLength` attribute to draw DaVinci lines
- `transform-box` property animates title text

### CSS Details
- Custom CSS counter for **Roman Numerals** instead of decimal lists
- Attention to classical art theme throughout

---

## ???? Bundle Size & Loading

### Final Size Breakdown
- **Mobile:** 2.4MB (target was 2MB)
- **Desktop:** 4.5MB

### Optimization Strategies
- Route splitting
- Dynamic imports
- Aggressive tree shaking
- Every PR scrutinized for size impact

---

## ????️ Shopify Platform Integration
